The wiki is read-only to prevent spamming. Contact me if you wish to add any pages or text.\r\n\r\n# Latest Release\r\nYou can always download the latest release from https://github.com/rsjaffe/MIDI2LR/releases/latest\r\n\r\n## Supported platforms\r\nA build for Windows is currently available, but the underlying framework is cross-platform, so a Mac build can easily be made\r\n\r\n## Proposed Project Plan\r\nPlease contact me if you have suggestions/changes for the plan.\r\n1. Move conversion from LR range to controller range from lua code to c++ code. Goals: remove the unwanted fader motor action caused by rounding errors, and prepare the application for wide-range MIDI control codes.\r\n2. Implement NRPN MIDI message handling. This will help with the wide-range parameters such as Color Temperature, as sensitivity of control can then be altered by speed of movement.\r\n\r\n## Screenshot\r\n![Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/Q4tFhL8.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
