I'm adding translation of menu items for the Lightroom plugin (but not the app).
For those interested in helping, the files to edit are named Translated_Strings_??.txt 
where ?? is replaced with the language code. The German translation has already been 
done by Niklas Mischkulnig.

To provide a translation for the project, edit the txt file in the language you want 
to translate. The only languages supported by Lightroom are German (de), English (en), 
Spanish (es), French (fr), Italian (it), Japanese (ja), Korean (ko), Dutch (nl), 
Portuguese (pt), Swedish (sv), Chinese simplified (zh_cn) and Chinese traditional (zh_tw).

The following text editors are recommended for editing these files:

In Mac OS X simply use TextEdit and make sure you save the file type as “UTF-8” 
(rather than UTF-16 or UCS-2, for instance).

In Windows use Notepad, and be sure to save the file as type “UTF-8.”

Each line in the file is formatted like "$$$/MIDI2LR/Stuff/name=The text to translate".
Leave everything to the left of the = sign alone, and replace the text to the right of 
the = sign with the translation. If you see a ^ sign followed by a number in the string, 
leave that alone as well--that gets replaced with a calculated value in the program. No 
newline characters or comments are allowed. The strings in this file must all be enclosed 
with double quotes. If you're wondering what a translated file looks like, compare 
Translated_Strings_en.txt with Translated_Strings_de.txt.

Send any translations to me at rsjaffe@gmail.com. Thanks for your assistance!
