My mapping for Lightroom CC using MIDI2LR and a Nexus 7 Tablet.
This should work on any other Ipad / Android tablets as long as your resize the TouchOSC UI file.

 - TouchOSC_Lightroom.touchosc

This is the file that you need to load in your device's ToucheOSC app. You can modify this file to suit your need and screen resolution with the TouchOSC Editor.

 - MIDI2LR_TouchOSC.xml

This is the MIDI2LR mapping file that you'll need to load. It can be automatically loaded when you go to develop module if you configure MIDI@LR options for that.

 - Presets

I am using 3 custom presets that I've mapped to the UI. You can change them if you need. See screenshot "MIDI2LR options presets.png" on how to map them.

 - Screenshots

Shows the TouchOSC pages and also the MIDI2LR options (highlighted in red) that you need to configure
