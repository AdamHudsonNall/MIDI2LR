# MIDI2LR
**MIDI2LR** is an application that interfaces MIDI controllers with Lightroom 6/CC. It processes MIDI input into develop parameter updates and photo actions, and sends MIDI output when parameters are changed for motorized feedback (on controllers that have motorized faders).

## Development status
Regretfully, I won't have time in the future to continue development.

If one wishes to continue development, please contact me at midi2lr@gmail.com.
I would also be happy to send the BCF2000 I've purchased to an eventual maintainer, free of charge.
